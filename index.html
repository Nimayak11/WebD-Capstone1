    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am Navya Nimayak, a CSE-AI sophomore who is
    currently enrolled in the 4-yr B.Tech program at
    IGDTUW. I am an avid student with an insatiable
    curiosity for applied computing and socio-cultural
    anthropology. Hailing from the historic city of Patna
    which is associated with the legacy of Ashoka the
    Great, I realized the potential of technology and how it
    could bridge the disparity that exists in our society.
    Artificial Intelligence as a discipline greatly interests
    me and is something that I would want to keep
    learning and building on. Apart from this, Iâ€™ve spent my
    childhood captivated by the beauty of Mathematics
    and its elegant logic and this fascination has only
    grown stronger over the years.</p>

    <h3>Internships</h3>
    <h4>Summer Internship (May - July 2023)</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          6 weeks Summer Internship on "VISUAL COMPUTING WITH PYTORCH" from 29th May - 9th July 2023
        </li>
        <li>
          Organized by Department of Artificial Intelligence and Data Sciences (AI & DS), Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women, Delhi.
        </li>
        <li>
          Over six dynamic weeks at IGDTUW, I delved into Visual Computing with PyTorch, crafting a Leaf Disease Detection model.
        </li>
        <li>
          Leveraging CNN and a pre-trained VGG16 model, I honed skills in image analysis and classification.
        </li>
        <li>
          This immersive internship empowered me to engineer solutions tackling real-world challenges in plant pathology, fostering a strong foundation in cutting-edge AI methodologies.
        </li>
        <li>
          The research paper for the same has been submitted at the 3rd International Conference for Innovation in Technology, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Brick Breaker Game</h4>
      </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Developed a program using Java, inspired by the
          arcade game (launched for the cell phone brand -
          Blackberry in 2007) that goes by the same name.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Leaf Disease Detection Model</h4>
      </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Developed a deep learning model that uses a
